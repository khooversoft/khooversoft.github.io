# Current Projects

I am taking on projects that fit into one of three categories.

1) Software language strategies, functional, DSL, how to build more powerful software with less cost.
2) Building cloud scale systems that is fast, fault tolerant, auto update, etc..., for less cost.  Specifically interested in transactional systems such as smart contracts with block chain.
3) Machine learning models and hosting as a service.

## XRun:
XRun is a orchestrator that executes activities in a pipeline.  Multiple pipelines can be packaged as a
workflow and can be executed across platforms and environments.  XRun can be embedded into executables
such as command line, web sites, micro services, etc...

Examples of applications...

- Development tools for build and executing multiple processes / systems for debugging, performance stress testing, etc...
- Running release processes and integration testing in DevOps build servers.
- Run as a service - listen for file modifying events, HTTP calls, etc..., and executes a specific pipeline when a file is changed.

## Message Net

Imagen a self configuring network that provides reliable messages, in order, that can support both greedy and broadcast
capabilities.  A reasonable queue system right?

The goal of this project is to make node to node(s) communication as simple as sending a message,
with all the tools to work with messages asynchronously.  Like simple networks, each node corporates as part of the network
of nodes.

## Performance
I wanted to see how the latest C# feature "switch expression" performs given it add a lot of functional programming
capability.  I was surprised how fast it was.
